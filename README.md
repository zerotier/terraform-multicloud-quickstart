## Status

* This is beta software.
* If we get enough positive feedback, we shall christen a 1.0.0.
* Here be Dragons (maybe).

## Conceptual Prerequisites

* ZeroTier Networks are objects in the Central API.
* ZeroTier Identities are the public keys of nodes; machines, containers, or binaries.
* ZeroTier Members are associations between Networks and Identities.
* ZeroTier virtualizes at L2 (ethernet).

This means:

* We can do a lot of cool stuff.
* Pinging IPv4 yields ARP table entries.
* Pinging IPv6 yields ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation.
* Across clouds, and through NAT devices.

## What lies ahead

This repository yields a lab environment for exploring ZeroTier.

- We shall ping
- We shall tcpdump
- We shall manipulate interfaces and bridges
- We shall do IPv6

No networking devices were harmed during the production of
this document.

## The plan

The general plan is simple. We shall use Terraform to create a
ZeroTier network, then spin up and bootstrap single virtiual machines
on each of AWS, GCP, and Azure. We shall then log into them and
explore the "layer2eyness".

## Technical Prerequisites

This quickstart requires the following environmental variables

```
# ZeroTier Central
export ZEROTIER_CENTRAL_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ZEROTIER_CENTRAL_URL="https://my.zerotier.com/api"

export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Google Compute Platform
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS="$(cat key-downloaded-from-gcp-console.json)"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="XXX-XXXXXX"

# Microsoft Azure
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
