## Conceptual Prerequisites

* ZeroTier Networks are objects in the Central API.
* ZeroTier Identities are the public keys of nodes; machines, containers, or binaries.
* ZeroTier Members are associations between Networks and Identities.
* ZeroTier virtualizes at L1 and L2 (ethernet).

This means:

* We can do a lot of cool stuff.
* Pinging IPv4 yields ARP table entries.
* Pinging IPv6 yields ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation.
* Across clouds, and through NAT devices.

## What lies ahead

This repository yields a lab environment for exploring ZeroTier.

- We shall ping
- We shall tcpdump
- We shall manipulate interfaces and bridges
- We shall do IPv6

No networking devices were harmed during the production of
this document.

## Technical Prerequisites

This Quickstart was written on an OSX laptop from a residential
ISP. 

To follow along step by step, you will need to create service accounts
on Digital Ocean, and at least one other cloud vendor. You will need
git, a text editor, and a copy of Terraform 1.0.0 or later installed
locally.

Terraform will create a ZeroTier network, then bootstrap instances on
various clouds. To follow along, you'll need service accounts on
Digical Ocean, and at least two other clouds.

The full blown multicloud demo uses

- Digital Ocean
- Amazon Web Services
- Google Compute Engine
- Microsoft Azure
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Alibaba Cloud
- IBM Cloud
- Vultr
- Equinix Metal

That's a lot of services providers. You'll need at least two for
demonstration purposes, but I recommend using them all for dramatic
effect. Digital Ocean was chosen at random to provide DNS service for
the lab.

The first time through, you will encounter a few hurdles. Each cloud
vendor brings their own special brand of pain. For example, on AWS,
you will need to accept the Marketplace agreement for the Ubuntu
AMI. On GCP, you will be prompted to enable Cloud APIs.

</p>

To lower the bar of entry, you can toggle which cloud vendors are
enabled in the config section. The process for creating cloud service
accounts is outside the scope of this document, but should be pretty
straight forward. You can do this. We beleive in you.

## Configure the Quickstart repository

Check out the source code for the quickstart and cd into the
directory.

```bash
laptop:~$ git clone git@github.com:zerotier/zerotier-terraform-quickstart.git
laptop:~$ cd zerotier-terraform-quickstart
laptop:~/zerotier-terraform-quickstart$ emacs variables.tf
```

### User account SSH keys

Next, add some SSH keys to the `users` variable. These will be passed to
[cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) when
bootstrapping the instances. You'll need at least one for yourself,
but we recommending adding a friend.

```hcl
variable "users" {
  default = {
    alice = {
      username   = "alice"
      ssh_pubkey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGxBkqXD41K8LfyJrjf8PSrxsNqhNUlWfqIzM52iWy+B alice@computers.biz"
    }
    bob = {
      username   = "bob"
      ssh_pubkey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKPxC8oiMHeqcTH507iWJbHs/4/yx3vOOBDf/n6Eowj7 bob@computers.biz"
    }
  }
}
```

### Device identities

Next, we will add the ZeroTier identities of the non-ephemeral devices
we plan to connect to our lab network. If you haven't already, install
the ZeroTier client on your laptop or workstation. You can get it from
the [ZeroTier Downloads page](https://www.zerotier.com/download/).

```bash
laptop:~$ zerotier-cli info
200 info a11c3411ce 1.6.5 ONLINE
```

```hcl
variable "devices" {
  default = {
    alice = {
      member_id   = "a11c3411ce"
      description = "Alice's laptop"
    }
    bob = {
      member_id   = "b0bd0bb0bb"
      description = "Bob's laptop"
    }
  }
}
```

### Enable or Disable Clouds

Next, select which clouds to enable. You'll need at least two for
demonstration purposes, but I recommend using them all for dramatic
effect. Digital Ocean is required, since it will be providing DNS
service for the lab.

```hcl
variable "instances" {
  default = {
    do = {
      description   = "Digital Ocean"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.1"
      enabled       = true
    }
    aws = {
      description   = "Amazon Web Services"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.2"
      enabled       = true
    }
    gcp = {
      description   = "Google Compute Platform"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.3"
      enabled       = true
    }
    azu = {
      description   = "Microsoft Azure"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.4"
      enabled       = true
    }
    oci = {
      description   = "Oracle Cloud Infrastructure"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.5"
      enabled       = true
    }
    ibm = {
      description   = "IBM Cloud"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.6"
      enabled       = true
    }
    vul = {
      description   = "Vultr"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.8"
      enabled       = true
    }
    ali = {
      description   = "Alibaba Cloud"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.7"
      enabled       = true
    }
    eqx = {
      description   = "Equinix Metal"
      ip_assignment = "10.4.2.9"
      enabled       = true
    }
  }
}
```
