## Conceptual Prerequisites

* ZeroTier Networks are objects in the Central API.
* ZeroTier Identities are the public keys of nodes; machines, containers, or binaries.
* ZeroTier Members are associations between Networks and Identities.
* ZeroTier virtualizes at L2 (ethernet).

This means:

* We can do a lot of cool stuff.
* Pinging IPv4 yields ARP table entries.
* Pinging IPv6 yields ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation.
* Across clouds, and through NAT devices.

## What lies ahead

This repository yields a lab environment for exploring ZeroTier.

- We shall ping
- We shall tcpdump
- We shall manipulate interfaces and bridges
- We shall do IPv6

No networking devices were harmed during the production of
this document.

## Technical Prerequisites

This Quickstart was written on an OSX laptop from a residential
ISP. 

To follow along step by step, you will need to create service accounts
on Digital Ocean, and at least one other cloud vendor. You will need
git, a text editor, and a copy of Terraform 1.0.0 or later installed
locally.

Terraform will create a ZeroTier network, then bootstrap a single
instance on each of Digital Ocean, Amazon Web Services, Google Compute
Platform, and Microsoft Azure. 

The first time through, you will encounter a few hurdles. Each cloud
vendor brings their own special brand of pain. For example, on AWS,
you will need to accept the Marketplace agreement for the Ubuntu
AMI. On GCP, you will be prompted to enable Cloud APIs.

</p>

To lower the bar of entry, you can toggle which cloud vendors are
enabled in the config section. The process for creating cloud service
accounts is outside the scope of this document, but should be pretty
straight forward. You can do this. We beleive in you.

## Configure the Quickstart repository

Check out the source code for the quickstart and cd into the
directory.

```bash
laptop~$ git clone git@github.com:zerotier/zerotier-terraform-quickstart.git
laptop~$ cd zerotier-terraform-quickstart
laptop~$ emacs variables.tf
```

### Enable Clouds

Next, select which clouds to enable. You'll need at least two for
demonstration purposes, but I recommend using them all for dramatic
effect. Digital Ocean is required, since it will be providing DNS
service for the lab.

```hcl
variable "enabled" {
  default = {
    do  = true  #-- required (provides DNS)
    aws = true
    gcp = true
    azu = true
  }
}
```

### User account SSH keys

Next, add some SSH keys to the `users` variable. These will be passed to
[cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) when
bootstrapping the instances. You'll need at least one for yourself,
but we recommending adding a friend.

```hcl
variable "users" {
  default = {
    alice = {
      username   = "alice"
      ssh_pubkey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIGxBkqXD41K8LfyJrjf8PSrxsNqhNUlWfqIzM52iWy+B alice@computers.biz"
    }
    bob = {
      username   = "bob"
      ssh_pubkey = "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIKPxC8oiMHeqcTH507iWJbHs/4/yx3vOOBDf/n6Eowj7 bob@computers.biz"
    }
  }
}
```

+### Device identities

Next, we will add the ZeroTier identities of the non-ephemeral devices
we plan to connect to our lab network. If you haven't already, install
the ZeroTier client on your laptop or workstation. You can get it from
the [ZeroTier Downloads page](https://www.zerotier.com/download/).

```bash
laptop~$ zerotier-cli info
200 info a11c3411ce 1.6.5 ONLINE
```

```hcl
variable "devices" {
  default = {
    alice = {
      member_id   = "a11c3411ce"
      description = "Alice's laptop"
    }
    bob = {
      member_id   = "b0bd0bb0bb"
      description = "Bob's laptop"
    }
  }
}
```

## Provision a ZeroTier Central API Token

## Set Environment Variables

Please place the following in your ```~/.bash_profile```, then run ```source ~/.bash_profile```

```
# ZeroTier Central
export ZEROTIER_CENTRAL_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ZEROTIER_CENTRAL_URL="https://my.zerotier.com/api"

# Digital Ocean
export DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Amazon Web Services
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

# Google Compute Platform
export GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS="$(cat key-downloaded-from-gcp-console.json)"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="XXX-XXXXXX"

# Microsoft Azure
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ARM_TENANT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ARM_CLIENT_ID="XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX"
export ARM_CLIENT_SECRET="XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
```

## Spin up the lab instances

```
terraform init && terraform plan && terraform apply
```

## Join Laptop to Lab Network

```
zerotier-cli join <networkid> allowDNS=1
```

## Log into and take a look around

```
ssh do.demo.lab
ssh aws.demo.lab
ssh gcp.demo.lab
ssh azu.demo.lab
```
