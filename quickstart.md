## Status

* This is beta software.
* If we get enough positive feedback, we shall christen a 1.0.0.
* Here be Dragons (maybe).

## Conceptual Prerequisites

* ZeroTier Networks are objects in the Central API.
* ZeroTier Identities are public crypto identities installed in nodes; machines, containers, or binaries.
* ZeroTier Members are associations between Networks and Identities.
* ZeroTier virtualizes at L2 (ethernet).

This means:

* We can do a lot of cool stuff.
* Pinging IPv4 addresses will yield ARP table entries.
* Pinging IPv6 addresses yields ICMPv6 Neighbor Solicitation.
* Across clouds, and through NAT devices.

## TLDR

This repository yields a lab environment for networking party tricks.

## Technical Prerequisites

This quickstart requires 4 environmental variables
